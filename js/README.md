# Bankist

The Bankist App is a modern banking application that allows users to manage their accounts, perform transactions such as transfers and loans, and view their financial history. It features a dynamic user interface with transaction sorting options.

Key JavaScript topics covered in this app include working with arrays, numbers, dates, internationalization (Intl), and timers. The app was developed as part of the JavaScript course by Jonas Schmedtmann. For improved readability, the original script.js file has been split into smaller, more manageable modules within the js folder.
